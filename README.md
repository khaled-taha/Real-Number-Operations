# Real-Number-Operations

Write a class called FloatNumber to implement the floating point number:

The class has two integer data members val and ndp. Where val represents the whole number
and ndp represents the number of decimal places. For example the number 235478.67 will be represented as val=23547867 and ndp=2

The class has two constructors:
a) A constructor the takes two integers one of them for val and the other of ndp
b) A constructor that takes a float and deduce( )تستنتجval and ndp from it

The class has the following methods:

a) Setters and getters for val and ndp
b) Add that takes a FloatNumber(as an object) and adds it to its object and returns the result object
c) Addinteger that takes an integer and adds it to its object and returns the result object
d) Mul that takes a FloatNumber(as an object) and multipliess it to its object and returns the result object
e) Mulinteger that takes an integer and multiplies it to its object and returns the result object
f) Round that rounds the object to the nearest integer and return the result as integer
g) Show that displays the object as a float number
